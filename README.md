These are source codes of the web game 1010 which is self-adaption.It can adapt iOS device and most of Android device but can not adapt windows phone in theroy.

If you run this web app in you mobile device, you'd better use the core chrome browser.

There are some infomation of project structure that maybe can help you:
- index.html is main file of this game, and there has many div to show.
- style.css is main stylesheet file.
